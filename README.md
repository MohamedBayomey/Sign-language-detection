# Sign-language-detection
This project develops a Sign Language Detection system to bridge the communication gap between hearing individuals and the deaf or hard-of-hearing community. Using machine learning and computer vision, the system detects and classifies American Sign Language (ASL) signs in real time, promoting accessibility.
